					<description><![CDATA[As the digital office has evolved, communication has developed a set of rules. Here’s how you can get the most out of your project management software.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The onboarding process for any employees — whether they&#8217;re remote or in house — follows the same procedure. Create an email login, sign into chat, set up your voicemail, save the conference dial-in number, and plug in your webcam. (Most companies stop short of assigning carrier pigeons to their employees or handing out guidebooks on Morse code.)</p>
<p>Communication is crucial in the workplace, and its level of effectiveness can make or break a project or an employee&#8217;s experience. As the digital office has evolved, communication has also developed its own set of rules. Here&#8217;s how modern employees best use their communication tools, and how you should use them in the office.</p>
<h2>How Have Our Office Conversations Evolved?</h2>
<p>Before we look at the tools we use to communicate, we have to look at what we&#8217;re saying. Previously, conversations between managers and teams focused on <em>what</em> needed to get done, but now people primarily discuss <em>how</em> to do things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Employee productivity and efforts have been improved, allowing them to place more emphasis on more important things such as precision and creativity,&#8221; says <a href="http://www.iofficecorp.com/blog/4-ways-technology-has-changed-the-modern-workplace" target="_blank">Elizabeth Dukes, Partner at iOffice</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The level of expectation of clients and co-workers has also changed as a result of technology in the workplace, keeping everyone connected on a constant basis. Results are expected much faster than ever before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Productivity software like <a href="https://www.teamfocus.me/">teamfocus</a> has been a major contributor in this transition, and some people are even advocating for it to completely replace email.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2499696,00.asp" target="_blank">Jill Duffy, author of Get Organized</a>, believes email only makes employees stressed and overwhelmed when it comes to project work. &#8220;The last few years, productivity enthusiasts have pushed knowledge workers to get off of email, or at least to ditch internal company email. An excellent way shift away from email is to all but ban it from project work and move that communication to a project management service instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, like the conference call and voicemail, email will continue to be an important part of communication. In fact, many of today&#8217;s communication tools will remain in use as long as each of them has an important purpose in the workforce.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each of us has personal preferences for communication based on what we feel is easiest — for example, some people have an easier time writing than speaking, and some people prefer meeting in person rather than the impersonality of text,&#8221; says <a href="http://www.inc.com/jayson-demers/communication-in-2015-text-voice-video-or-in-person.html" target="_blank">Jayson DeMers, founder and CEO of AudienceBloom</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s important to see beyond the limits of our own convenience. The selection of a medium can have a drastic impact on both the efficiency of your communication and the interpretation of your message.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rest of this article will discuss when each form of technology is appropriate, and how teams can use it to the fullest.</p>
<h2>When Should You Meet in Person?</h2>
<p>The oldest form of technology is our human bodies, which communicate verbal and nonverbal cues more effectively than any other channel. This is still the preferred method when forming personal bonds and discussing sensitive information.</p>
<p>&#8220;A study from Adobe found that Millennials value interpersonal interaction over digital interaction at work,&#8221; says <a href="http://www.cio.com/article/3082775/unified-communications/millennials-are-shaking-up-workplace-communication.html" target="_blank">Sarah White, writer at CIO</a>. &#8220;While 81 percent of Millennials said &#8216;state of the art technology&#8217; was paramount to an ideal working environment over perks or amenities, 55 percent they valued in-person communication at work over digital.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, she says those same respondents tended to overestimate how much everyone else relies on digital communication tools. &#8220;46 percent of respondents anticipated their peers to value IM and texts over interpersonal communication, but the real number ended up being just 11 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just because young people are known for texting and online communication doesn&#8217;t mean society&#8217;s preference for human engagement is changing.</p>
<p>But sometimes, unintentionally or otherwise, messages get lost in the digital either.</p>
<p>In an article for Quartz, <a href="http://qz.com/523049/its-hard-to-fire-people-who-work-remotely-as-one-unfortunate-twitter-employee-just-discovered/" target="_blank">writer Max Nisen</a> covered the story of Bart Teeuwisse, a remote employee at Twitter who found out he was laid off when he couldn&#8217;t access his work accounts.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a manager can&#8217;t just pull someone into an office or a conference room, sometimes, as in this case, the logistics of layoffs — i.e. closing out company email accounts — get in ahead of informing the affected staff personally. Even the phone is not the option it once was, now that so many of us ignore calls and voicemails.&#8221;</p>
<p>With remote work, it&#8217;s not always possible to meet in person, but managers should be mindful and make a concentrated effort to get on the phone with affected employees before sensitive news breaks.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5163" src="https://www.teamfocus.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/phone-1024x682.jpg" alt="phone" width="1024" height="682" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/phone-1024x682.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/phone-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/phone-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/phone-600x400.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/phone.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>Are Phone and Conference Calls Still Effective?</h2>
<p>Many people have become frustrated with the conference call. It&#8217;s viewed as a time suck and a way to talk about work without actually doing it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to both be engaged and seem engaged,&#8221; says <a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/careers/articles/2015/10/21/a-remote-workers-guide-to-conference-calls" target="_blank">writer Laura McMullen</a> for US News. &#8220;You have to fight for just. one. second. to jump in and add your two cents without feeling like Godzilla, stomping on other people&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to somehow catalog every team member&#8217;s voice and distinguish one from another. And you have to wrestle with bad connections, sound delays and other technological voodoo that seems to curse every call.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, despite the frustrations, many remote employees enjoy regular check-ins, and they use them as opportunities to ask questions and get to know their team members.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may think you are 100% approachable as a manager,&#8221; writes the team at <a href="https://justworks.com/blog/surefire-ways-make-remote-employees-loathe-you" target="_blank">JustWorks</a>. &#8220;But if you don&#8217;t actually explain to your remote employees how you can be approached, they&#8217;re going to err on the side of not approaching you at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>They recommend setting regular calls to give employees a chance to discuss issues and ask questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Create] a daily or weekly meeting that is always scheduled where the employee has a reason to call in and talk to you. It can be for ten minutes a day, but what you&#8217;re giving them is the chance to talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, weekly phone calls are only as effective as your team is at listening. One survey by <a href="https://www.westuc.com/en-us/blog/conferencing-collaboration/mobile-conferencing-changing-how-we-work" target="_blank">West Unified Communications Service</a> found 64% of employees do other work while on a conference call. Meanwhile, the rest are using the time for other activities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Workers take full advantage of the multitasking opportunities that mobile conferencing provides,&#8221; they write. &#8220;Respondents claimed to be doing all kinds of other tasks while on a mobile conference call. The multitasking activities included: getting other work done, sending emails, eating, texting, social media, video games, shopping and even going to the restroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, 27% of respondents said they&#8217;ve fallen asleep during a conference call.</p>
<p>While phone communication and conference calls are here to stay, voicemail is officially optional. Washington Post columnist <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2015/06/04/the-end-of-office-voice-mail/" target="_blank">Jena McGregor</a> writes that companies like Coca-Cola and JPMorgan Chase have disconnected voicemail entirely because it&#8217;s considered outdated and time-consuming.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve all sat through rambling, five-minute-long messages from people who really should have sent a two-line email. We&#8217;ve all screened numbers we didn&#8217;t want to answer and then — minutes later — gotten a redundant email or cell phone call. And we&#8217;ve all wondered if that automated, robotic voice saying &#8216;message. received. on. Thursday. June. 4th. at. 2. 53. pm&#8217; could really be any slower.&#8221;</p>
<h2>How Has Email Communication Evolved with Technology?</h2>
<p>While conference calls might drag employees down, there&#8217;s a general consensus that important communication should be funnelled through phone calls if two parties can&#8217;t meet in person. Most experts believe that email is no place for sensitive discussions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never confront via email — it suggests you&#8217;re afraid of confrontation, which suggests you aren&#8217;t committed to your message,&#8221; says <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/244492" target="_blank">Ross McCam mon, articles editor at GQ magazine</a>. &#8220;Plan what you&#8217;re going to say, but don&#8217;t script it out &#8230; like you would if you weren&#8217;t addressing a difficult matter. Point out the way you may be contributing to the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Email should be the last place you turn when trying to communicate with an employee. Even company chat boxes provide more of a back-and-forth conversational feel than an email.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t send a confrontation email to someone unless you&#8217;ve tried to get in touch with him or her every other possible way with no success, or if the problem is so urgent that he or she needs to be told immediately and the only available option is email,&#8221; agrees <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/confronting-an-employee-over-email-5-tips-for-doing-it-right" target="_blank">Lily Herman, managing editor at WayUp</a>.</p>
<p>However, if you&#8217;re on the fence about sending the email, Herman recommends use the six-sentence rule.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you feel like you can&#8217;t explain your case in six sentences or fewer, perhaps the subject is too big and hairy for email. After all, you don&#8217;t want to minimize a delicate situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside of confrontational situations, email is getting ignored because workers think it&#8217;s slow. The response time and length required to draft it bog down the process more than chat or a phone call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sending an email isn&#8217;t always the fastest way to say something,&#8221; says team members <a href="http://glasscanopy.com/send-email-pick-up-phone-how-to-decide/" target="_blank">glassCanopy</a>. &#8220;Sometimes, I spend more time drafting an email than I would in a phone call communicating the same information. That may be partly because I&#8217;m a wordsmith by trade; but also because emails that contain a lot of information deserve a higher level of curation.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is often because people use email when they want to document something that can be referenced later, or communicate specific instructions.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5162" src="https://www.teamfocus.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/email-1024x683.jpg" alt="email" width="1024" height="683" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/email-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/email-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/email-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/email-600x400.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/email.jpg 1677w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>How Does the Modern Workforce Use Chat?</h2>
<p>The frustrations behind long conference calls and tedious email chains have caused a new hero to arise in the world of office communication: chat boxes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chat is far more efficient than long, drawn-out email chains (who likes those, anyway?),&#8221; says <a href="https://www.formassembly.com/blog/remote-teams-communicate/" target="_blank">Hannah Wright at FormAssembly</a>. &#8220;Plus, there&#8217;s one more bonus: It&#8217;s fun.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing to keep in mind is that written text lacks the subtle cues of in-person conversation. With chat, you do need to be careful about how your words might be interpreted and possibly misunderstood. That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s an abundance of emoticons and gifs in our everyday chats — they&#8217;re useful in conveying the right nuances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chat is one of the best ways for remote employees to ask quick questions from across the world and even get to know the people they work with better.</p>
<p>&#8220;When working remotely, team members don&#8217;t have a chance to make small talk with their neighbor in the next cubicle or discuss weekend plans by the coffeemaker,&#8221; says <a href="https://www.teambonding.com/5-team-bondingtips-for-remote-employees/" target="_blank">Samantha McDuffee for Teambonding</a>. &#8220;It&#8217;s that kind of personal chit-chat, however, that helps employees relate to each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>The best part is that chat creates an even plane, as in-house employees are using chat even more. This means remote employees aren&#8217;t left out of conversations (and in-house teams get to use emojis in their professional instruction).</p>
<p>&#8220;Trendy open-plan offices are infamous for their cacophonous din — they were originally designed to get workers across the office to strike up conversations that hopefully lead to innovative collaborations,&#8221; says <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2015/04/slack_and_the_office_chat_several_people_are_typing_who_s_working.html" target="_blank">Amanda Hess, writer for The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;While bosses are free to convene closed-door meetings, it&#8217;s hard for underlings to have a private word unless they physically leave the premises. But now, Slack has given every employee a virtual office door, and boy do we use them.&#8221;</p>
<p>If project management software has changed what we talk about, so that more teams are focusing on how things should get done, then it makes sense for chat to rise up as the leading communication tool. It&#8217;s the platform for quick questions and team collaboration, both of which are crucial for meeting deadlines and moving work forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rise of <a href="https://www.teamfocus.me/project-management-software/">project management software</a> has made it easier for managers to delegate tasks and communicate with employees, but that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean they&#8217;re delegating well. </p>
<p>Many supervisors continue to micromanage, miscommunicate and stress out their employees with the help of modern technology. Follow the advice of these 16 managers to learn how to delegate effectively with project management software. </p>
<h2>Evaluate What Needs to Be Delegated</h2>
<p>Whether the task is going to a remote freelancer or in-house employee, managers need to be careful deciding what assignments go to which employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;When matching individuals or teams to projects, take into consideration their ability, skills, experience and goals,&#8221; says business etiquette expert <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/247758" target="_blank">Jacqueline Whitmore</a>. &#8220;Some tasks are more mundane than others. In this case, find someone who thrives on routine tasks. For the more intricate projects, find someone who likes a challenge and knows to tackle the manageable parts of the job before diving into the more complicated aspects.&#8221; </p>
<p>Speaking of mundane tasks, start by reviewing your own workload and questioning where your time goes. You might be able to eliminate redundant tasks and save both you and your employees time.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.thebalance.com/top-tips-for-effective-delegation-2951528" target="_blank">Alyssa Gregory, founder of the Small Business Bonfire</a>, has seen small business owners struggle to let go of their tasks and daily activities. When you&#8217;ve been doing it on your own for so long, it can be challenging <a href="https://www.teamfocus.me/managers-guide/">to let go</a> of the reigns. </p>
<p>&#8220;If you kept track of everything you do during your workday, I bet you&#8217;d be surprised to see where your time is going and what qualifies as your biggest time drains. This alone can be a powerful tool for identifying potential tasks to delegate, and even tasks to eliminate from your business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once you know what you want to delegate, it&#8217;s time make sure the training and onboarding process runs smoothly. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.teamfocus.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/training-1024x683.jpg" alt="training" width="1024" height="683" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5144" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/training-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/training-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/training-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/training-600x400.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/training.jpg 1678w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>Take Time to Onboard New Hires to Your Tasks</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re hiring someone to take work off your plate, you can&#8217;t expect them to learn everything immediately. It&#8217;s the role of the delegating manager to take a step back and make sure their employees are balancing their responsibilities well.</p>
<p>&#8220;New hires need to not only prepare themselves mentally with knowledge, but they need to be emotionally prepared as well,&#8221; says <a href="http://theundercoverrecruiter.com/turn-hire-great-employee/" target="_blank">Sarah Landrum, writing for Undercover Recruiter</a>. &#8220;Throwing them too much at one time can overwhelm them and make them feel as though they won&#8217;t be able to succeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best way to handle this is to set milestones and provide small batches of training material at a time. Once the employee has completed a batch, he/she should receive another one, and so on and so forth.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.uassistme.co/blog/best-delegation-practices-for-a-virtual-or-remote-team-member" target="_blank">Rodolfo Schildknecht, co-founder of Uassist.ME</a>, emphasizes the importance of detailed onboarding for all employees, especially virtual ones. </p>
<p>&#8220;A virtual employee&#8217;s onboarding only consists of formal onboarding meetings, and misses out on valuable hallway chatter and impromptu meetings. For this reason, it&#8217;s important to make those initial onboarding sessions as valuable as possible. Spending this time upfront can help your virtual employee produce higher quality work from the get-go, without coming back and forth to you with questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>While it might be easy for an in-house employee to ask a one-off question, remote employees have a harder time contacting and explaining their problems or concerns. </p>
<h2>Create Assignments That Will Challenge and Inspire Employees</h2>
<p>Along with offloading time-consuming tasks, managers also want to delegate projects that will help employees grow. After all, they&#8217;re proteges, not secretaries. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.profitguide.com/manage-grow/leadership/how-to-give-instructions-your-employees-will-actually-follow-92618" target="_blank">Merge Gupta-Sunderji, leadership development consultant</a>, explains that employees don&#8217;t like receiving busy work or tasks with no end result. To prevent this, provide context to why you&#8217;re asking them to do something. </p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to increase the likelihood of getting the end-result you desire from your employees, tell them why what you&#8217;re trying to communicate matters. In the workplace, we&#8217;re dealing with adults. Chances are you didn&#8217;t buy your parents saying &#8216;Because I said so&#8217; when you were a child, so why would it be true for the adults you employ?&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.getbridge.com/give-employees-room-to-stretch" target="_blank">Jeff Weber, SVP at Instructure, Inc.</a>, recommends assigning &#8220;stretch assignments,&#8221; or a project that challenges employees to grow outside of their normal duties.</p>
<p>&#8220;One way to do this is to meet with employees individually and ask them what types of projects they&#8217;d like to work on or what skills they&#8217;d like to develop, and then use that information to assign them to a project you wouldn&#8217;t normally have tapped them to complete before you knew their interests.&#8221; </p>
<p>These assignments give employees a sense of purpose, while giving them a new challenge to master at work. </p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re not providing stretch assignments, simply highlighting the benefits of completion can ease the onboarding process of delegation. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-delegate-work-to-your-team-without-being-annoying" target="_blank">Tim Sieck, principal partner with On Target Talent</a>, was inspired by Adrian Gostick&#8217;s &#8220;WIIFM&#8221; philosophy, or &#8220;What&#8217;s in it for me?&#8221; which assigns a reason for doing something that benefits the employee, along with a task.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frankly, it doesn&#8217;t matter why you want the job done. If your employee can&#8217;t find a reason to want to do it, he or she may say no. So, if the employee has expressed an interest in being promoted, discuss how this project will prove valuable in achieving that goal.&#8221; </p>
<p>Other motivational incentives include networking, skill-building and long-term ease of workload. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.teamfocus.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/learn-1024x682.jpg" alt="learn" width="1024" height="682" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5142" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/learn-1024x682.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/learn-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/learn-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/learn-600x400.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/10/learn.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>Give Employees the Freedom to Grow and Learn</h2>
<p>Now that your team is armed with stretch assignments and tasks, you can take a step back and let them work. </p>
<p>&#8220;If you are a new manager, you need to recognize that your job is now managing people, not tasks,&#8221; says <a href="http://er.educause.edu/blogs/2015/6/why-autonomy-is-important-for-peak-performance" target="_blank">Joan Cheverie at Educause</a>. </p>
<p>&#8220;This is the point where you stop telling your staff how to do their job and, instead, set the strategic direction, deadlines, and benchmarks and then allow them to determine how to accomplish the job.&#8221; </p>
<p>This fulfills your employees&#8217; need for choice and an ability to make decisions of their own volition. </p>
<p>&#8220;Effective delegation is when you give a task to someone who knows both what they have to do and how to do it how to get it done on time,&#8221; explains <a href="http://www.tonylbrown.com/best-way-to-delegate-tasks-to-my-freelancer" target="_blank">business systems strategist Tony Brown</a>. &#8220;It is giving a task to someone who can take responsibility for that task if it changes. Ineffective delegation is when you give a task to someone else and it doesn&#8217;t save you any time or money.&#8221; </p>
<p>This means managers who spend just as much time assigning, reviewing and tracking the progress of a task are failing to delegate effectively, as it&#8217;s causing them just as much stress as if they did it themselves. </p>
<p>In the same way you&#8217;re reviewing your employees whom you delegate to, you should review yourself as a manager. <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3052984/know-it-all/four-signs-youre-micromanaging-your-employees" target="_blank">Baron Schwartz, founder and CEO of Vivid Cortex</a>, discovered he was micromanaging when he became part of the problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Employees might put it delicately (which can make it easy to miss), but if they communicate that you&#8217;re the cause of a delay, you&#8217;re probably in too deep. &#8230; Try to take a step back and ask whether it&#8217;s a decision you should be making in the first place. Can one or more of your team members make that call just as well on their own?&#8221;</p>
<p>On the employee side, communicating any problems or issues up front can save time and frustration down the road. </p>
<p><a href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/articles/2016-01-19/how-to-handle-a-micromanaging-boss-without-getting-fired" target="_blank">Certified career coach Hallie Crawford</a> found being proactive was an important step for employees on the receiving end of micromanaging behaviors. </p>
<p>&#8220;If you notice that it happens at a certain time of day, provide your boss with an update an hour in advance of that time. When it occurs before or after a specific meeting, help prepare your manager in advance of that meeting for whatever he needs to report on.&#8221; </p>
<p>Some managers actually hope to inspire employees to reach this level of proactivity as a sign they can be left alone. </p>

<h2>Choose the Right Time to Assign Tasks</h2>
<p>Another important aspect of digital project management is knowing when to assign tasks to employees. Even if you&#8217;re just sending comments or assigning tasks before you forget them, you could cause undue stress within the team. </p>
<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2015/03/your-late-night-emails-are-hurting-your-team" target="_blank">Maura Nevel Thomas of Regain Your Time</a> wrote an article for the Harvard Business Review about communicating with employees in their off-hours: </p>
<p>&#8220;If the boss is emailing late at night or on weekends, most employees think a late night response is required — or that they&#8217;ll impress you if they respond immediately. Even if just a couple of your employees share this belief, it could spread through your whole team. … After all, everyone is looking for an edge in their career.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, researchers at the University of Illinois have coined the term &#8220;telepressure,&#8221; or the urge to immediately respond to work communication.</p>
<p><a href="http://time.com/3560203/stress-work-email/" target="_blank">Mandy Oaklander, health editor at TIME magazine</a>, found telepressure has long-term psychological effects on employees, including lost sleep, higher levels of burnout and health-related absences. Furthermore, she found that few employees are exempt from the pressure to respond immediately to their managers. </p>
<p>&#8220;Individual differences are only weakly associated — telepressure is a workplace problem, not a worker problem. We learn how to respond to email through our colleagues&#8217; behavior &#8230; and it&#8217;s a consequence of the social dynamics within a work environment.&#8221; </p>
<p>As a manager, it&#8217;s your job to set the tone of the workplace and let employees know that it&#8217;s OK to disengage. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/employer-blog/delegating-tips-for-remote-managers/" target="_blank">Matt Krumrie, writing for Flexjobs</a>, offers advice to managers trying to communicate with remote teams. With the rise of chat windows through Gmail, Slack and Skype, it&#8217;s easy to track your employees&#8217; availability throughout the day. However, this can be misleading. </p>
<p>&#8220;If your remote worker forgets to turn on IM in the morning, or leaves status at &#8216;away&#8217; for what seems like hours, don&#8217;t hover at that status, wondering where they are or if they are working. Sometimes, when things get busy, remote workers may step away, update their status, and come back and forget to update that status. &#8230; Trust them to do the job. Lead them to succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>This can be difficult for remote workers in different time zones, but this respect and behavior will result in happier employees in the long run. </p>
<h2>Make Sure Your Instructions are Clear and Detailed</h2>
<p>There is a whole art to assigning new tasks to employees. Make sure you are giving the proper instructions for them to complete those tasks. Offering the right information can make the difference between successful or frustrated employees. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.tinshingle.com/blog/how-give-directions-work-right-way-aka-you-have-tell-them-where-put-parsley" target="_blank">Sabina Hitchen, co-founder of Tin Shingle</a>, was inspired by her mom — a professional chef — who taught her how to give effective directions to her staff. One key ingredient is face time. </p>
<p>&#8220;Set specific times of the day or week to stop everything else you&#8217;re doing and go through the directions and expectations for a new project. This also lets them prepare any question about said project and bring the to the meeting.&#8221; </p>
<p>This is also important for remote employees, who should be able to call into address any questions or concerns. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2015/10/21/how-delegate-freelancers-and-virtual-assistants-essay" target="_blank">KerryAnn Rockquemore, speaker on faculty development and leadership</a>, has found the same principles apply to a virtual team as in-house staff. </p>
<p>&#8220;If you know how to designate tasks, establish benchmarks and bring out the best out in people, you can find an awesome virtual team to support you.&#8221; </p>
<p>She also encourages managers to keep the lines of communication open and provide detailed feedback on performance early on. </p>
<p>&#8220;When you work with people virtually, they will have questions and need feedback. (They don&#8217;t just magically do perfect work without any guidance.) It&#8217;s far better to answer questions and over communicate up front than to be disappointed later on by an unsatisfactory outcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virtual success through project management software relies on many of the same principles as in-house work. Managers that respect their employees and communicate well will have an easier time than those who provide limited directions but continue to micromanage their staff. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest challenges managers face is finding the right software tool for their teams. Some lean toward the cheapest option without the right features, while others buy all the bells and whistles regardless of the cost. Both of these methods are flawed, as they fail to evaluate what the team members actually need and how to give it to them.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve previously discussed the challenges managers face during the process of <a href="https://www.teamfocus.me/enterprise-workflow-system/">onboarding team members to a new system</a>.</p>
<p>Without employee input or buy-in, you could easily end up with a vendor that many team members ignore, preventing future collaboration and project tracking.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are many options to choose from when looking for a project management service. Here are a few common features and types of project management software to consider when shopping for a tool.</p>
<h2>Reduce Pressure on Overwhelmed Team Members</h2>
<p>Between <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/vanessaloder/2015/04/24/75-of-companies-struggle-with-overwhelmed-employees-here-are-three-tips-to-cope/#7ef7b1ff4f0e" target="_blank">65 and 75 percent of employers</a> report having overwhelmed employees. One of the main causes is multi-channel communication in the modern workplace. Between meetings, calls, emails, and chat apps, instructions come from several different channels and don&#8217;t stop when an employee leaves the office.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed employees are less productive, require more stress-related sick days, and have a higher turnover rate. This means your rockstar employee who works until 10 p.m. and <a href="https://www.teamfocus.me/managers-guide/">never takes any vacation time</a> could actually cost you more in the long run than some who clocks out at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>To do list project management software takes all of the noise from the workplace and channels it into one central platform. Instead of digging through long email threads and chat conversations to find a deadline or client instructions, employees can use workflow-based software like ours and find everything they need in one place.</p>
<p>Not only does the software reduce stress by eliminating noise, but it also helps your employees take projects one step at a time to hit their due dates. Your employee only has to look at what their day and week entails, and won&#8217;t have to think about other project assignments until the future.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.teamfocus.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Camera-1024x683.jpg" alt="Camera" width="1024" height="683" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5107" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Camera-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Camera-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Camera-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Camera-600x400.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Camera.jpg 1840w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>Identify Visual Learners and Creative Thinkers</h2>
<p>One of the top reasons for investing in project management software is to make sure nothing slips through the cracks in any project. However, before you can decide on the right tool, you need to understand why your instructions or tasks are getting missed. If you&#8217;ve ever rattled off a long list of items that need to get done in a meeting, only to have half of them come into fruition, it&#8217;s possible you&#8217;re surrounded by visual learners.</p>
<p>More than <a href="http://www.phschool.com/eteach/social_studies/2003_05/essay.html" target="_blank">65 percent of the population</a> consists of visual learners, while less than 20 percent are auditory learners. No matter how important a long list of client tasks are, your team is unlikely to remember them all unless they&#8217;re written down. This is where visual management software comes in.</p>
<p>At the very least, your team can see everything that needs to be done in a prioritized list and has a better chance of remembering what&#8217;s assigned to them.</p>
<p>However, visual software tools go deeper than that. They can map out the project through completion with assigned touchpoints for every employee. They also use colors to report status updates and engage creative thinkers.</p>
<p>Not only are visuals more engaging, but they also set your employees up for success. Images process faster than text, and they are <a href="http://info.shiftelearning.com/blog/bid/350326/Studies-Confirm-the-Power-of-Visuals-in-eLearning" target="_blank">stored in the long-term memory</a> whereas written text and verbal instruction stays in the short-term memory.</p>
<p>By opting for visual management software, you&#8217;re creating opportunities for your employees to remember more in meetings to produce better results after them.</p>
<h2>Quantify Your Tasks With Metrics</h2>
<p>While we champion the learning style of visual learners, not everyone has that mindset. Your managers and more technical departments might want a snapshot of how the project is coming along and where any hold-ups are.</p>
<p>For these employees, look for high-level dashboards that provide a quick overview of projects and their completion rates. The dashboards should allow managers to quickly see whether a project is on time, on budget, and in the right hands. If not, those managers should quickly be able to see how far behind it is, and what (or who) is causing the issue.</p>
<p>This is typically what CEOs look for in project management task software. They want to make sure their teams and employees are getting work done, but don&#8217;t want to micromanage their staffs. Account representatives also use these tools to report progress to a client, without giving too much away or breathing down the necks of the production teams.</p>
<p>The beauty of high-level reporting is that managers can immediately know what&#8217;s going on, but employees can click into the dashboard for more detailed tasks. Everything they need — from instruction decks to client feedback — is there for them to use, without their managers checking to make sure they have it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.teamfocus.me/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Work-Station-1024x683.jpg" alt="Work Station" width="1024" height="683" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5109" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Work-Station-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Work-Station-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Work-Station-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Work-Station-600x400.jpg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Work-Station.jpg 1840w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>Look for Offline and Remote Options</h2>
<p>More companies than ever are offering work-from-home options as a way to recruit prospective employees. <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3034286/the-future-of-work/will-half-of-people-be-working-remotely-by-2020" target="_blank">Fast Company</a> has even suggested that half of the American workforce will have work-from-home options by 2020. Even employees who can&#8217;t technically work from home find themselves answering calls and emails long after they left the office. All of these factors emphasize the value of a Windows task management software with offline and remote options.</p>
<p>Your employees need to access their projects from anywhere, whether they&#8217;re preparing for a meeting on their train to work, checking in when their flight is delayed, or balancing client meetings with summer camp. They don&#8217;t always have the time and ability to log into the company&#8217;s servers.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s a chance your employees will use your project management task software outside of your physical building, you want to make sure they can sign in on the go, from their personal laptops, or <a href="https://www.teamfocus.me/support/mobile-app/">via smartphone apps</a>.</p>
<p>These are just a few criteria to look for in your project management tools. We recommend bringing in a few early adopters to test drive your options before deciding on a vendor. Your employees will quickly tell you what they like (and what they don&#8217;t) so you know how to prioritize their needs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="//teamfocus.me/">teamfocus</a> is an incredibly powerful project team management system that uses Workflows at its heart. A major part of this power comes from the customizability that teamfocus provides out of the box. Why is this customizability important?</p>
<p>The simple fact is that every company is different—or at least the successful ones differentiate themselves. In any given market there may be room for more than one company to be successful. In fact, there could be several market leaders.</p>
<p>In their 1995 book <em>The Discipline of Market Leaders,</em> authors Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema outlined three types of market leaders, based on their <strong>strategic focus</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies that aim for <strong>operational excellence</strong>;</li>
<li>Companies that are committed to <strong>product leadership</strong>; and,</li>
<li>Companies that are dedicated to <strong>customer intimacy</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>What should be immediately clear is that in order to successfully differentiate themselves along lines like these, companies will need to have remarkably differentiated strategies. These will dictate unique business processes, and thus the company aspiring for market leadership will require <em>customized workflows</em>.</p>
<p>If we look at a simple ordering process for a consumer electronics company, the processes might differ as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>An operationally excellent company might offer a simple web form for customers that quickly integrates to the ordering, credit and shipping systems within the company so that the order ships quickly;</li>
<li>A product leader might set itself up with a retail place to showcase its products to its customers, who can then purchase from stock, or order in for later delivery; or,</li>
<li>A company dedicated to its customers might send a representative to the customer’s premises to determine their specific needs and wants and to provide a completely customized solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the end result is a customer ordering and receiving a product, the processes are very different, and the workflows within the company would need to be optimised. Using teamfocus as a system for task management for teams will help to keep everything together.</p>
<p>Every person in the company will need to be aware of the strategic focus (i.e. operational excellence, product leadership or customer intimacy) and their role within this. Processes and workflows need to be tied together seamlessly.</p>
<p>As stated a couple of weeks ago in our post of <a href="https://www.teamfocus.me/personal-productivity-teams/">Personal Productivity for Teams</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>most breakdowns in business processes occur not within the discrete process elements, but within handoffs (or transitions) between process elements…</p></blockquote>
<p>So a true workflow cannot be a canned, out-of-the-box thing. It must be unique—unique to the company and its strategic focus.</p>
<p>As a web based task management solution <a href="//teamfocus.me/">teamfocus</a> provides the ultimate flexibility in setting up customized employee task management capabilities. The workflows can be customized, and so can the reporting. This is something that should not be overlooked—there is an old saying that suggests ‘you get what you measure’.</p>
<p>The great thing about <a href="//teamfocus.me/">teamfocus</a> is that it’s an online task management system for organizations large and small. With a <a href="https://www.teamfocus.me/pricing/">free option for up to three users</a> teamfocus can even be a family task manager.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to release our latest round of improvements and features for teamfocus, our incredibly powerful project team management system.</p>
<p>Along with the many small enhancements which help make using teamfocus easier to use, there are two key features which stand out. If you’re new to teamfocus <a href="//www.teamfocus.me/tour/" title="Tour" target="_blank">click here to watch the Tour video</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Secure Text Fields</strong></p>
<p>The first key innovation for the this release is centred around security. As you know, teamfocus already offers the ability to add as many custom Fields as you need to your Workflow, and now we’ve added a new one, the <strong>“Secure Text Field”.</strong></p>
<p>Secure Text Fields enable you to create and store data with extra security inside your teamfocus Workflow.</p>
<p>Secure Fields ensures that whatever data you store in that text field, like a Passport or Social Security Number, is now encrypted in your browser before it’s sent to teamfocus, and is only ever decrypted once it comes back to your browser. teamfocus will never be able to see what you have encrypted, which means that if we are ever requested by a law enforcement agency to hand over your data, all that we can provide is encrypted data which will be useless to anyone but you. This is a great feature for anyone concerned about their personal data ever being seen by anyone other than themselves. This also means that if you need to delete your data quickly and permanently, you simply delete your encryption keys.</p>
<p>There are many other small features and changes we have made in this release which makes your life with teamfocus even easier. So checkout our How To – Secure Fields video below to see how to setup and use Secure Fields for your Team.</p>

<p><strong>Task Finder</strong></p>
<p>Our second highlighted feature is <strong>“Task Finder”</strong>, which is an easy and fast way to find all of your tasks, and the Filters they are on.</p>
<p>For example, if you wanted to find all the tasks that are currently Active and that have not been actioned for more than 30 days (making them a Red task) you can now drill down and save that List of tasks to your favorites. Tasks Finder also lets you choose if you want to share the new Filter with your Team.</p>
<p><strong>Drill down in “Find Tasks” to select the tasks you want to see.</strong></p>
